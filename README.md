# Charity demonstration application
## Update

The first version of Charity application was written over 2 years ago as an MVC application. It is still available on my Github and can be reached in the cloud.
This was my first contact with MVC, because so far I have dealt mainly with simple APIs and static html pages.

There are three reasons that led me to rework the application:
1. It's been a long time since my first steps in AST.NET and old code should be removed. It's perfectly working code, but my coding style has evolved. The old application does not reflect my current style.
1. I watch the development of Blazor and I found find this framework worth getting part of my stack.
1. The Blazor concept based on reusable front-end components is similar to Angular, React or Vue. So knowing Blazor will also help you understand these technologies.

As of today, the project files represent the Clean Architecture layered application concept.
On this basis, the backend and UI components will be built in the coming days.
